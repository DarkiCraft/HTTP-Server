# ðŸ§ª Git Guide for Our OS Project

Hello Pookies! This guide will help you get started with Git and GitHub for our OS project. Follow the steps carefully and donâ€™t hesitate to ask if youâ€™re confused at any point.

---

## âœ… Step 1: Initial Git Setup
This only needs to be done ONCE.

If you havenâ€™t already, install Git:  
ðŸ”— https://git-scm.com/downloads

After installing, open your terminal and set your identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "<your-github-username>"
git config --global user.email "<your.email@example.com>"
```

Clone the project from GitHub to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DarkiCraft/os-project.git
cd os-project
```

Each teammate should make their own branch to work independently:

```bash
git checkout -b "<your-branch-name>"
```

These are the branch names we will use:
- Ali   -> `ali`
- Ammar -> `amm`
- Arham -> `arh`
- Me    -> `abd`

This lets everyone work without breaking each otherâ€™s code.

## âœ… Step 2: Update to the Latest Commit

Before making any changes to your code, make sure you are synced to main

```bash
git checkout "<your-module-name>"
git pull origin main
```

---

## âœ… Step 3: Work on Your Code

Make changes in your code (in VS Code preferably). Then save and commit your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<comment changes>"
```
The comment is necessary. Try to make it descriptive to what changes you implemented.
Finally, push your changes to your branch:

```bash
git push origin "<your-branch-name>"
```

---

## âœ… Step 4: There is No Step 4!

Your work is done. Iâ€™ll review your changes and merge it into the main branch.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary of Commands

```bash
# First time setup
git config --global user.name "<your-github-username>"
git config --global user.email "<your.email@example.com>"

git clone https://github.com/DarkiCraft/os-project.git
cd os-project

git checkout -b "<your-module-name>"

# Before working on code changes, make sure you are on the latest commit
git checkout "<your-module-name>"
git pull origin main

# Save and upload your changes
git add .
git commit -m "<comment changes>"
git push origin "<your-branch-name>"
```
